# Meetup Data Toulouse: Experiment Tracking With Mlflow

This repo is an adaptation of the official *pytorch* examples of mnist training.  
Upon this repository we add a layer for tracking hyperparameters and metrics with
a tool called mlflow.  
This is part of a presentation of this tool in a meetup in Toulouse in 2019.
